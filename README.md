# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
Explain the purpose of this analysis
We are tasked with analyzing data over standardized math and reading test scores. Overall, we want to prepare all standardized test data for analysis, recording, and presentations to provide an insight about performance trends and patterns. More specifically, we want to see how the school's test scores are impacted by spending bugdets, school size, and type of school as these affect making decisions regarding school budgets and priorities. 

In addition to the above, we have been notified by the school board that there is evidence of academic dishonesty. Specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. We have taken these scores out of the analyzation and reporting on how these changes affected the overall analysis, including the specified analysis for each category mentioned in the above paragraph. 

## Results: 
*	How is the district summary affected?
*	How is the school summary affected?
